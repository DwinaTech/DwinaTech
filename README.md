# Helloooo

You are welcome to my world. :wave:

I am Mohammed Dwina, I am a JavaScript software engineer. :sunglasses:	

I am crazy about coding, problems solving and team collaboration. :purple_heart:	

I like to create, build and making new things, briefly I like discovering new useful things. :house_with_garden:	

I also like a social gathering, meet new friends, watching films, football and go to the gym. :soccer:	:film_projector:	

Feel free to get in touch.  :call_me_hand:
